# Pair Of Numbers Java
The program takes input from stdin in the format "a|b", where a,b are positive integers. As output, the program produces 
multiple lines using the format [X of Y], where Y counts the amount of different second parts.

For instance, if input is 

3|78 <br/>
4|7765<br/>
3|82<br/>
2|8<br/>
4|14<br/>
3|78<br/>
2|8<br/>
4|12<br/>

then output is

3|78[1 of 2] <br/>
4|7765[1 of 3] <br/>
3|82[2 of 2]<br/>
2|8[1 of 1] <br/>
4|14[2 of 3] <br/>
3|78[1 of 2] <br/>
2|8[1 of 1] <br/>
4|12[3 of 3] <br/>
